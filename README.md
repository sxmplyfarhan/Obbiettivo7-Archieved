## How was the website made?

Originally the website was for a school project. We didnt want to use google slides so we made a website.
Me and my friend Azan made the structure and the code. The other 3 made the text and gave us support.
We used HTML and TAIlWIND. 

## Howd you get the website working and keeping it online?

Well this is where we ran in to an issue. We didnt have a server so we hosted the website on netlify.app. Yes a free website hoster.
